## Overview

This worksheet helps you define two key ordinal variables for analysis:

1. **Archaeological Periods** — arrange chronologically from earliest to latest
2. **Tomb Types** — arrange by complexity, labor investment, or prevalence

The dictionaries you complete here will be imported automatically into your analysis files.

## Period Dictionary (`data/period_dictionary.csv`)

### What to Fill In

Three columns need your input:

| Column | What to Enter | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `chronological_order` | A number ranking this period chronologically (1 = earliest, higher = latest) | 1, 2, 3, 4... |
| `earliest_component` | If this is a range period, the earliest single period it includes | For "LHIIA-LHIIIB", enter "LHIIA" |
| `latest_component` | If this is a range period, the latest single period it includes | For "LHIIA-LHIIIB", enter "LHIIIB" |

### Examples

**Single Periods** — entry columns are the same:

```
period_code,period_name,chronological_order,earliest_component,latest_component
LHIIA,Late Helladic IIA,5,LHIIA,LHIIA
LHIIIB,Late Helladic IIIB,11,LHIIIB,LHIIIB
```

**Range Periods** — earliest and latest differ:

```
period_code,period_name,chronological_order,earliest_component,latest_component
LHIIA-LHIIIB,Late Helladic IIA to IIIB,8,LHIIA,LHIIIB
MH-LHIII,Middle Helladic to LHIII,15,MH,LHIII
```

**What this means:**
- The range "LHIIA-LHIIIB" spans from period 5 (LHIIA) to period 11 (LHIIIB)
- R will later extract both the start and end period for analysis
- This lets you analyze: "When did this grave context start?", "When did it end?", or "What's the span?"

### Filling It In

1. **Determine chronological order:** Arrange all periods from earliest (1) to latest (highest number)
   - See standard Aegean chronologies (Rutter, Manning, etc.)
   - MH typically comes before LH
   - Within LH: LHI → LHII → LHIII
   - Subdivisions (IIA, IIB) fit sequentially

2. **For single periods:** Copy the period code to both `earliest_component` and `latest_component`

3. **For range periods:** Identify the start and end, then copy them to the respective columns
   - "LHIIA-LHIIIB" → earliest = LHIIA, latest = LHIIIB
   - "MH-LHIII" → earliest = MH, latest = LHIII

## Tomb Type Dictionary (`data/tomb_type_dictionary.csv`)

### What to Fill In

One column needs your input:

| Column | What to Enter | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `tomb_type_order` | A number ranking this tomb type (1 = first, higher = last) | You decide the ordering criterion |

### How to Rank Tomb Types

Choose **one** ranking system and apply it consistently:

**Option A: Architectural Complexity** (simplest → most complex)
- Simple grave (1)
- Pit (2)
- Cist (3)
- Chamber tomb (4)
- Tholos (5)

**Option B: Labor/Resource Investment** (least → most)
- Natural crevices (1)
- Simple grave (2)
- Pit grave (3)
- Cist grave (4)
- Built chamber tomb (5)
- Tholos (6)

**Option C: Frequency in Dataset** (rarest → most common)
- Count which tomb types appear most often
- Rank accordingly

### Your Tomb Types

Here are the actual tomb types in your dataset. Choose **one** ranking system and assign each a number:

| Tomb Type | Option A (Complexity) | Option B (Labor) | Option C (Frequency) | Your Choice |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| natural crevices | 1 (simplest) | 1 (least labor) | ? (count in data) | |
| simple grave | 2 | 2 | ? | |
| grave | 2-3 | 2-3 | ? | |
| circle | ? | ? | ? | |
| pithoi/pithos/Pithos | 2-3 | 2-3 | ? | |
| pit/pits | 3 | 3 | ? | |
| cist | 4 | 4 | ? | |
| dromos of tholos | varies | 4-5 | ? | |
| shaft grave | 3-4 | 4 | ? | |
| chamber tomb | 5 | 5 | ? | |
| build/built chamber tomb | 5 | 5-6 | ? | |
| tholos | 5-6 (most complex) | 6 (most labor) | ? | |
| mound | ? | ? | ? | |
| Grave peribolos | ? | ? | ? | |
| graves in settlement context | 2-3 | 2-3 | ? | |

**Notes:**
- Some types are unclear from the dataset — use archaeological knowledge to rank them
- "grave" and "simple grave" are probably similar (assign similar ranks)
- "build chamber tomb" and "built chamber tomb" are likely the same (assign same rank)
- "pithoi/pithos/Pithos" (burial in large storage jars) is relatively simple
- If you choose **Option C (Frequency)**, count how many graves of each type appear in the dataset and rank from rarest to most common

### Filling in Your CSV

Once you've decided on a ranking system, fill in the **"Your Choice"** column above, then copy those numbers into `data/tomb_type_dictionary.csv` in the `tomb_type_order` column.

**Example (using Option A: Complexity):**

```
tomb_type,tomb_type_order
natural crevices,1
simple grave,2
grave,2
circle,3
pithoi,2
pit,3
cist,4
shaft grave,4
dromos of tholos,4
chamber tomb,5
build chamber tomb,5
built chamber tomb,5
tholos,6
mound,3
Grave peribolos,4
graves in settlement context,2
```

**Key points:**
- You can use the same number twice (e.g., "simple grave" and "grave" both = 2)
- Numbers don't have to count up perfectly (e.g., you can go 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6)
- But they should be sequential overall (no gaps like 1, 2, 5, 6)
- The actual numbers don't matter — R only cares about the relative order

## How These Will Be Used in Analysis

Once you've filled these in, the analysis code will:

1. **For periods:** Automatically match range periods to their earliest/latest components
2. **Create new columns:** `period_start_order`, `period_end_order`, and `period_midpoint_order`
3. **For tomb types:** Use your ranking to create an ordinal factor for statistical tests

This lets you analyze relationships across time and tomb architecture!

## Checklist Before Submitting

**Period Dictionary:**
- ☐ All periods have a chronological order number
- ☐ Numbers count up (1, 2, 3... no gaps, no duplicates unless periods occur simultaneously)
- ☐ Single periods have matching `earliest_component` and `latest_component`
- ☐ Range periods have different start and end components
- ☐ Start component chronologically precedes end component

**Tomb Type Dictionary:**
- ☐ All tomb types have a ranking order number
- ☐ Ranking is consistent across all types (you can see your logic)
- ☐ Numbers are sequential (1, 2, 3... or in logical order)
- ☐ You documented your ranking system and rationale

## Questions?

If you're unsure about:
- **Period dating:** Check archaeological chronology tables (Rutter 2014, Manning 2010)
- **Period sequences:** Look at the period names — Roman numerals usually help (I before II before III)
- **Tomb types:** Consider what makes sense for your research question about drinking vessels and burial practices
